Toy website with an implementation of the Wong-Baker pain chart. I did everthing the hard and tedious way. 

[The website is live](https://ea0eaa22de669df91c9534893cbf78e2de274654-www.googledrive.com/host/0B9AtPXmoEFUzUFczMUNyTGFZclk/final/), being hosted by Google Drive and run by ShiftEdit. Total hosting costs: $0.00. 

This is the only dynamic version of this famous chart I found, everything else was just low-res scans of static images. If you click the buttons, the faces get bigger. 

Enjoy and may all your faces be full smiley.
